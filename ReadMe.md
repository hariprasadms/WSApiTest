# Demo API Automation Test Framework

The framework can demostrate below capabilities,

1. Validating Status code
2. Validating api schema
3. Validating array size of the api's
4. Create data using a post request with a body ( I have used a random generated UUID  technique to create unique data )
5.  Api utility methods ( This is to develop reusable api calling methods )
6. Data model POJO classes ( This is json deserialization. This helps to bind data from Json and validate data effectively)
7. Dynamic data passing from another endpoint and its validation ( This is also called as API chaining )
8. Testng assertions
9. Testng listeners to customize default testng reports.
10. Maven build ( builds can run successfully )
11. Emailable report ( This is the default report generated by Maven and TestNG. However we can integrate extend report library as well )
